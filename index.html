	<h2>The Trip</h2>

		The trip itself was pretty fun. It was farther than expected but the trip was great either way. Archer Malmo didn't look as expected. The building is also a cotton musueum which through me off when I found out that it was where we were going. The entrance looked nice and going into it, the place wasn't bad at all.

	<h2>The Experience</h2>

		Although the presentation was very lacking in enjoyment the over all experience was enjoyable. The one thing I do enjoy from Archer Malmo was the office space. It was more hip instead of your tradtional "office style" look. There a ping pong table in the office! Everyone seemed to have their own office space and wasn't crowded by others around them.
		They also had their own studio for making commercials and videos in. I think my favorite part visiting was probably the studio, but if I had to work anywhere in a office I would want the environment to be like theirs.

	<h2>What I Learned</h2>

		I got to learn a lot about how web designing and coding works there. It was nice to actually see what I could be doing working in job focused on creating websites. I think i learned a lot about the routines, how layed back it can be, and how fun it could be working there. I also learned a lot about how they sketch out there projects before completing them and how they adjust the website depending on what the user is viewing on. Overall I learned a lot there about how they go about creating the websites.

		One of my favorite parts of the trip was lunch after. I had a lot of fun socializing and talking after the trip discussing about our trip. The food was great and I will definitely have a lot a memories after eating there.

		My final analysis about this trip was I had a GREAT time. The trip itself was super fun and it was a great learning experience. I had fun looking around the office and also seeing the types of people in the workspace. Overall I think all of us could've learned something from the trip and take away some kind of information in the process of this trip.
